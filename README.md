# ApulianCovidStatisticsDashboard
A simple Dashboard for the real-time (daily changes) visualization of data regarding Apulian Covid-19 statistics released by Italian Civil Protection.

For sake of demonstation, I deployed this web application on a free-hobby Heroku droplet available at the url: <br><br>

https://covid-dashboard-apulia-af.herokuapp.com/

To note, the droplet is running as a free version, thus after 30 minute of inactivity it is forced to enter in sleep mode. Thus, if you try to reach the url, you should visit it a first time, and after the error message you can finally access the website a second time after 1-2 minutes (time needed for the web-application to wake-up). 
I apology but unfortunaltely this is a free web-server (very useful anyways).
